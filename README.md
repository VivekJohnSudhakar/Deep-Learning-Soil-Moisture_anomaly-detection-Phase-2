## Phase 2
This contains code from my work at NCICS (North Carolina Institute formClimate Studies) on phase 2 of the project Soil Moisture Anomaly Detection.
For phase 2 - Deep learning methods, code is present in 2 directories Hydra and Acclima (corresponds to the data set used).
Corresponding README under each directory is present. <br />
